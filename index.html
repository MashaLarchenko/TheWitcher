                    The Witcher, a new Netflix fantasy saga the streaming service has positioned as the next Game of
                    Thrones, has similar literary roots. The show is based on the fantasy book series of the same
                    name—six novels and two story collections by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski that develop a rich
                    setting and unforgettable characters that have drawn in millions of readers the world over. The
                    eight-episode first season debuted December 20 and stars Henry “Superman” Cavill as Geralt of Rivia,
                    a monster-hunter, as he gets embroiled in political intrigue, doomed romances, and a lot of bloody
                    battles.

                        <p>
                            Geralt is a witcher (sometimes called a “hexer”, depending on the translation). Witchers are
                            monster-hunters, specializing in tracking down and slaying (or banishing) a variety of
                            creatures, monsters, and supernatural entities. Witchers start their training at a young
                            age, from within the stronghold of Kaer Morhen. They are given a cocktail of drugs, potions,
                            and powders that grant them an expanded lifespan and greater stamina, skill, and speed than
                            the average human. However, the process irrevocably changes them, leaving them with strange
                            and distinctive eyes. Witchers face prejudice for their unusual appearance and abilities,
                            and often disparaged as “mutants.” Despite this, their services are in constant demand as
                            the Continent is frequently troubled by monsters and the undead.

                            Geralt is famed as one of the most skilled and experienced witchers of his age. He also has
                            a knack for finding himself in the wrong place at the wrong time, attracting the unkind
                            attention of kings, generals, and sorcerers. Although witchers are supposed to be
                            apolitical, Geralt often finds himself embroiled in political intrigue and military matters,
                            especially as tensions rise between the independent Northern Kingdoms and the vast
                            Nilfgaardian Empire to the south.

                            The books and the forthcoming adaptation also focus on characters other than Geralt. The
                            other major characters of the saga include Yennefer, a powerful sorceress and ally of
                            Geralt’s, and Ciri, a young princess whom Geralt takes as a ward. Geralt’s closest friend is
                            the bard Jaskier (known as “Dandelion” in the video games; see below), who chronicles
                            Geralt’s adventures (and gets embroiled in them himself).

                        <p> Geralt’s adventures take place in a world that seems like the stuff of standard fantasy, but
                            that’s only true superficially. Yes, there are humans, elves, dwarves, and other familiar
                            nonhuman races. But the world is harsher than many others: the elves have suffered grievous
                            losses from the encroachment of humans into their lands and now many have banded together as
                            guerrilla fighters, desperate to retain their freedom; sometimes, they overstep the mark are
                            carry out acts of terrorism.

                            The books are suffused with European myth, history, and folklore. Several of the Witcher
                            stories recall familiar fairy tales viewed in a different light: think Snow White as a
                            ruthless killer. There are vampires and werewolves and dragons, and a mysterious spectral
                            force known as the Wild Hunt. There are also other worlds and other times, and some people
                            can visit them through sorcery.

                            The main setting—the Continent—is also the home to more mundane nations and kingdoms:
                            Redania, Temeria, Cintra, Toussaint, and Nilfgaard are some of the more notable ones. Great
                            cities such as Vizima and Novigrad play key roles in the story. From the towering peaks of
                            the Blue Mountains, where the witcher stronghold of Kaer Morhen can be found, to the
                            snowswept Skellige Isles, the witcher’s world is one of adventure, heroism, tragedy, beauty,
                            and war.</p>

                        In 1996 and 1997, a Witcher video game was being developed by Metropolis Software in Poland, but
                        it was canceled. The game's director was Adrian Chmielarz, former People Can Fly co-owner and
                        creative director, who coined the translation "The Witcher" during its development. According to
                        Chmielarz, the game would have been a 3D action-adventure game with role-playing elements such
                        as moral choices and experience points.

                        In 2003, Polish video-game developer CD Projekt Red negotiated with Sapkowski for rights to The
                        Witcher, given the languishing work at Metropolis, and released The Witcher, a role-playing
                        game based on the saga in October 2007 for personal computers. It was well-publicized and,
                        although it was the developer's first game, it received critical praise in Europe and North
                        America. The Witcher was published in Poland by CD Projekt and worldwide by Atari. A console
                        version, The Witcher: Rise of the White Wolf with the same story and a different engine and
                        combat system, was scheduled for release in fall 2009 but was canceled that spring.

                        The Witcher: Crimson Trail, also known as The Witcher Mobile is
                        a mobile-phone action game created by Breakpoint on license from CD Projekt in November
                        2007. It features a young Geralt as a promising student who has completed his training to
                        become a monster-slayer – a witcher.

                        The Witcher: Versus was a Flash-based multiplayer fighting browser game, developed for CD
                        Projekt Red by one2tribe and released in 2008. In the game, which has been discontinued, players
                        created a character from one of three classes and challenged other players in battle.

                        The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings is the sequel to The Witcher, developed by CD Projekt Red. On
                        16 September 2009, before Assassins of Kings was introduced, a video of the game was leaked;
                        two days later, CD Projekt Red confirmed that it was in development.[58] Assassins of Kings was
                        published in Poland by CD Projekt, by Namco Bandai Games in Europe and by Atari in North
                        America. The game was also distributed digitally through Steam and DRM-free on Good Old Games.

                        CD Projekt Red announced Battle Arena, a free-to-play multiplayer online battle arena game for
                        mobile devices, on July 1, 2014.

                        Wild Hunt was released on 19 May 2015, and has become considered one of the greatest games of
                        all time, shipping over ten million copies by March 2016.[60] By March 2018, the series as a
                        whole has sold over 33 million.

                        Geralt appeared as a guest character in the 2018 fighting game, Soulcalibur VI.

                        The first season, consisting of eight episodes, was released on Netflix in its entirety on
                        December 20, 2019. It is based on The Last Wish and Sword of Destiny, which are collections of
                        short stories that precede the main Witcher saga. Before the first season had been released,
                        Netflix announced a second eight-episode season, to be released in 2021; production was
                        scheduled to commence in London in early 2020.
                        The first season was told in a non-linear manner, spanning different time periods. Hissrich said
                        this was inspired by Christopher Nolan's 2017 film Dunkirk. She pointed out that Yennefer's
                        story covers around 70 years and Ciri's only about 2 weeks. Hissrich also said that Yennefer
                        and Cirilla were given more prominence to allow the viewers to understand them better. By
                        showing their backstories, along with Geralt's, “ we get down to the soul of the story. It's the
                        story of a broken family. It's a story of three people who are on their own in the world, really
                        orphans all living in the margins of society who are determined to not need anyone, and yet of
                        course they do.”

                        Hissrich said the story for the second season will build on the foundations of the first season,
                        becoming more focused; the characters will interact with each other more frequently.
